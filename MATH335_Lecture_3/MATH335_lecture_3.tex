The following is a recap of a short lecture on how to compute the greatest common denominator and least common multiple of two very large integers. \\\\
\thm Division Algorithm:
Let $a,b\in \Z, b>0$ then:
\[
  \exists !\quad q,r \in \Z : a=qb+r\quad 0\leq r < b
\]
\begin{proof}
  Let S be the following nonempty set:
  \[
    S=\{a-bk: k \in \Z \land a-bk \geq0\}
  \]
  First show that s is nonempty: If $a\geq 0$ then for k=0$ a-bk=a$ which means a is in the set. \\\\
  If $a<0$ then let k=2a therefore $a-b(2a)=a(1-2b)$ so for all b since a is negative we get a product of two negative numbers which is postiive. \\\\
  If $0 \in S $ then $\exists q \in \Z$ such that $a-bq=0$. This means that $a=bq+0$ or $a=bq$ \\\\
If $0 \notin S$ since S is a nonempty set of positive integers by the well ordering principle there exists a smallest element of that set since the set S is then a subset of the natural number . let this smallest element be r. $r\in S, r\in \Z^+, r=\min(S)$\\\\
So there exists an integer q such that $r=a-bq$ this implies that $a=bq+r$ \\\\
We now need to show that r is smaller than b: Suppose that r is not smaller then b, this would imply that $r\geqb$ which means that $a=bq+r$ but since r is greater than b we can right the expression as $b(q+1)+(r-b)$ but since r is greater than b $ r-b$ is non negative. $r-b \geq 0$ Hence r-b should be in s however r-b is smaller r but r is supposed to be the smallest element in S by the well ordering principle. 
\end{proof}
